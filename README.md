# Mobile_Development_Android_Application
 An Android application created for the third year mobile development module

The aim of this project was to create an Android application using the Kotlin programming language. This involved creating game which can demonstrate a science-based topic suitable for secondary school level students. The application should utilise features appropriate to the android platform to create a fun and engaging way for students to learn about a particular science subject. The application presented for this assignment is a game named ‘Tardigrade Adventure’ which aims to inform students on the topic of microbiology.

The game has been implemented to exploit the features available to the mobile platform. Sensors such as the accelerometer have been utilised to enable the user to control the player character by tilting the device in the appropriate direction that they wish the character to move. The application also takes advantage of the light sensor which enables the user to view different prey and enemies depending on the light level the device is currently receiving from its sensor.

The project also takes advantage of the more advanced features of the Kotlin language such as extension functions and higher-order-functions which can offer a succinct method to avoid code duplication that would otherwise only be avoided using cumbersome constructions in other OOP languages.
